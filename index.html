            Choosing my favorite food is always a tough one for me because I love making food and going out to eat as well.  When I'm making food at home, anything with pasta is always a winner.  Working at Olive Garden for a few years has inspired me to love anything with pasta.  I think I should say cheese coneys are my favorite type of food.

           This is literally always changing for me.  Music is a huge part of my life and I am listening to a different band each week.  Over the past week I have been jamming out to a ton of Whitechapel and Knocked Loose.  I really can't pick between those two currently.
        </p>
        
        <p>I watch too much Netflix.  I could say the same thing about TV shows that I do about music.  A newer show I have been watching and loving is called Legit.</p>
        
        <p>There are a decent amount of things keeping me happy.  The fall semester starting up has put me into an awesome mood.  Seeing a ton of people on campus is great!  I basically lived on campus this summer; it didn't even feel like I was on summer.  It's nice to see NKU not looking like an actual ghosttown.</p>
